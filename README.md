A project developed in C for the Operating Systems II course of my Uni. The program performs text analysis by generating a word frequency table and uses it to produce random text based on calculated word frequencies. It supports both single-process and multi-process execution modes, demonstrating inter-process communication and concurrency.

**_Features_**

Parses Italian text to compute word occurrence frequencies
Generates random text based on word frequency data
Supports CSV input/output for data processing
Includes a Makefile and detailed documentation for easy compilation and usage

**_Directory Structure_
**
UniMonoC: Contains the single-process implementation of the project
UniMultiC: Contains the multi-process implementation, featuring inter-process communication with at least three concurrent processes
