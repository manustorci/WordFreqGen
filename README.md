A project developed in ANSI C for the Operating Systems II course of my Uni. The program performs text analysis by generating a word frequency table and uses it to produce random text based on calculated word frequencies. It supports both single-process and multi-process execution modes, demonstrating inter-process communication and concurrency.

Features:

- Parses Italian text to compute word occurrence frequencies
- Generates random text based on word frequency data
- Supports CSV input/output for data processing
- Includes a Makefile and detailed documentation for easy compilation and usage
